# Faisal Ur Rehman Portfolio

A React-based portfolio website deployed on GitHub Pages with a custom domain.

**Live Site:** [https://faisalurrehman.me](https://faisalurrehman.me)

## SSL/HTTPS Configuration

This site uses HTTPS via GitHub Pages with a custom domain. To ensure SSL works properly:

### DNS Configuration (at your domain registrar)

Configure the following DNS records for your domain:

**A Records** (for apex domain `faisalurrehman.me`):
```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

**CNAME Record** (optional, for www subdomain):
```
www.faisalurrehman.me -> FaisalRehman30001.github.io
```

### GitHub Repository Settings

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under "Custom domain", verify `faisalurrehman.me` is set
3. Check **"Enforce HTTPS"** checkbox to enable SSL

### Verification

After DNS propagation (may take up to 24-48 hours):
- GitHub automatically provisions an SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt
- All HTTP requests will be redirected to HTTPS
- The site includes a Content-Security-Policy that upgrades insecure requests

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
